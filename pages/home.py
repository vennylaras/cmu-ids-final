        and a sense of well-being for human beings. Even after a person achieves great things in life, \
        like money, fame, or success in the field they're in, a real sense of achievement in life is not \
        complete unless people are happy with their lives, which often comes from a sense of community support, \
        having a purpose to live, and so on.")
